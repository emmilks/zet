General guidelines for writing a an effective scientific paper.

## The Introduction

The introduction should be three paragraphs long. It should provide a
general overview of the current research, the unknowns, and what was
done in the experiment.

1.  First paragraph: (Opening) What is broad research area?
2.  Second paragraph: (Challenge) What are the unknowns or cannot be
    done?
3.  Third paragraph: (Action, Resolution) Overview of what was done or
    what was found?

## The Results

You need to explain why you did what you did before you describe how you
did it. Each result should follow this breakdown.

1.  What do we want to know? Be specific.
2.  What did we do?
3.  What did we observe?

## The Discussion

This is where is you interpret and discuss the meaning of the results.
In the first paragraph repeat everything said so far.

1.  First paragraph: (Opening) What is broad research area?
2.  Second paragraph: (Challenge) What are the unknowns or cannot be
    done?
3.  Third paragraph: (Action, Resolution) Overview of what was done or
    what was found?

The subsequent paragraphs should elaborate on these issues with one to
two paragraphs each:

1.  How can we interpret our findings?
2.  How do our findings relate to other work in the field?
3.  What are the weaknesses/drawbacks of our work?
