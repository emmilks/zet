* Color Scales
There are four uses of color in data visualization.

1. Distinguish categories (qualitative)
   - Orderless
   - Even colors. Do not highlight one category over the others.
2. Represent numeric values (sequential scale)
   - Ordered
   - *Perceptually uniform*. Each step looks like the same size as the
     previous step.
3. Represent numeric data (diverging scale)
   - two sequential scales that meet in the middle.
   - correlation coefficient is an example
4. Highlight
   - Make certain data values stand out from the rest of the values.

Your choice of color scale can create a very different impression and
you can highlight certain aspects of the plot or not. Pick an
appropriate color scale for each of these four categories or you could
confuse or mislead your audience.

** =ggplot2= Color Scale Functions are a Mess
This table is not exhaustive.

| scale function                  | aesthetic  | data type   | palette type            |
|---------------------------------+------------+-------------+-------------------------|
| =scale_color_hue()= color       | discrete   | qualitative |                         |
| =scale_fill_hue()= fill         | discrete   | qualitative |                         |
| =scale_color_gradient= color    | continuous | sequential  |                         |
| =scale_color_gradient2= color   | continuous | divergent   |                         |
| =scale_fill_viridis_c()= color  | continuous | sequential  |                         |
| =scale_fill_viridis_d()= fill   | discrete   | sequential  |                         |
| =scale_color_brewer()= color    | discrete   | qualitative | , sequential, divergent |
| =scale_fill_brewer()= fill      | discrete   | qualitative | , sequential, divergent |
| =scale_color_distiller()= color | continuous | qualitative | , sequential, divergent |

The =colorspace= package creates some order out of the ggplot mess.

Scale name: =scale_<aesthetic>_<datatype>_<colorscale>()=

- aesthetic: fill, color
- datatype: discrete, continuous, binned (histogram with color)
- colorscale: qualitative, sequential, diverging, divergingx

** Discrete, Qualitative Scale
This scale is best set manually. =ggplot= could do a poor job choosing
the colors. If you have more than eight categories then trying to encode
them in color is the wrong approach. Use facets instead. Typically use
three to four colors in a single plot
