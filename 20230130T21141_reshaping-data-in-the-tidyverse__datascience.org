Long format data is better for machines and doing analysis. Wide format
data is better for humans. It is more intuitive and easier to read. It
is common, as a data analyst, that you will receive data in a wide
format and you will need to convert it to a long format in order to do
your analysis. After the analysis, you should convert the data back into
a wide format for the report so your manager doesn't have to think to
hard.
