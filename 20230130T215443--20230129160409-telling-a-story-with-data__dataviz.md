# Data Storytelling

-   Every figure needs a clear purpose in the story arc.
    -   introduction -\> challenge -\> action -\> resolution
-   The complete arc usually requires at least two figures.
-   Prepare figures that make a clear point. Do not want to confuse or
    mislead the audience.
-   Make your figures memorable. Get creative when it is feasible to do
    so.
