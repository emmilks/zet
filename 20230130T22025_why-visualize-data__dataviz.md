Data analysis is useless if you cannot communicate your findings to
other people. A picture says more than 1000 words.

## Why R?

It lives at the intersection of programming, statistics, and
communication. R has a lot of features and extra packages that let you
do all three of these topics extremely well. Better than most other
programming languages. It was built by statisticians to do statistics
with a computer.
