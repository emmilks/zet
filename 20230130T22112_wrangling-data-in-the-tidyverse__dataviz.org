* Wrangling Data in the Tidyverse
Data wrangling is the process of performing operations on a dataset that
change it some way in order to answer questions or clean it up for
future analysis. Data in the real world is often messy and not fit for
analysis in its raw form.

** Elementary Data Manipulations
| Operation      | Tidyverse Function                     |
|----------------+----------------------------------------|
| Pick rows      | =filter()=                               |
| Pick columns   | =select()=                               |
| Sort rows      | =arrange()=                              |
| Count things   | =count()=                                |
| Add columns    | =mutate()=                               |
| Analyze        | =group_by()= and =summarize()=             |
| Reshape        | =pivot_wider()= and =pivot_longer()=       |
| Combine tables | =left_join()=, =inner_join()=, =full_join()= |

=%>%= and =|>= are the pipe operators. Output from the first function is
fed as input nto the second function. It can be read as "and then".
