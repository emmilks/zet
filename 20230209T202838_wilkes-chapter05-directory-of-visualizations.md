This provides a general overview of the different data visualization methods
and where these visualizations are the most appropriately used.

Bar and dot plots are used for visualizing singular amounts. Grouped and stacked
bar charts can be used when there is more than one category to visualize. A
heat map is also a good visualization for this type of data.
