# Getting to Know Your Data

A complete record of data providence requires more info

1.  Motivation
2.  Composition
3.  Collection Process
4.  Preprocessing/Cleaning/Labeling
5.  Uses
6.  Distribution

## Motivation

These are examples of questions you want to ask when researching the
motivation behind creating the dataset.

-   For what purpose was the dataset created?
-   Who created the dataset?
-   Who funded the creation of the dataset?

If the dataset contains controversial information, you want to make sure
the creators of the dataset do not have an agenda.

## Composition

-   What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent? Twins
    with two entries or just one for the pair?
-   How many instances are there in total?
-   Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample
    (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set?
-   Is any information missing from individual instances?

## Data providence: Collection Process

-   How was the data associated with each instance acquired?
-   If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling
    strategy?
-   Were there any ethical review processes conducted? You cannot just
    do experiments on humans.
-   Did the humans consent to the collection and use of their data? LOL!

## Data providence: Preprocessing/cleaning/labeling

-   Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling done?
-   Was the raw data saved in addition to the
    preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data?

## Data providence: Uses

-   Has the dataset been used by others?
-   Is there a repo that links to any and all papers or systems that use
    the dataset?
-   What other tasks could the dataset be used for?
-   Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? There
    might be a bias that makes the dataset unsuitable for a given task.

## Dataset providence: Maintenance

-   Who is maintaining the dataset? Is it guaranteed to exist in the
    future?
-   How can the owner be contacted?
-   Will the dataset be updated? How will the updates be communicated?
    How often? By whom?
-   If the dataset relates to people, are there applicable limits on the
    retention of the data associated with the instances? Someone may
    have only consented to one study, not two or more. Retain privacy.
